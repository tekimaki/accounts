            <p style="margin-top:0px;">Every day across our country, millions of Americans take time away from their work, their studies, and their families to give back to their communities.  Millions more Americans would like to help solve local problems, but they are wondering:</p>
            <p>How can I get involved?  Where can I make a difference?</p>
            <p>Cities of Service is a bi-partisan coalition of the mayors of large and small cities from across our country who will work together to engage citizens to address the great challenges of our time.  Founded in New York City on September 10, the coalition and its member cities will respond to the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act's historic call to action by finding new and innovative ways to harness the power of volunteers to help solve pressing local challenges.</p>
            <p>Cities of Service will lead a multi-year effort to engage other Mayors across the country by: </p>

            <ul>
              
              <li>Developing a comprehensive service plan and a coordinated strategy focused on matching volunteers and established community partners to the areas of greatest local need.<br>
                <br>
              </li>
              <li>Working with other mayors and elected officials to advance strategies and best practices that accelerate the service movement and produce measurable results.<br>
                <br>
              </li>
              <li>Encouraging other mayors to join this national effort to engage our citizens.<br>

                <br>
              </li>
              <li>Ensuring that the voice of cities is heard in federal legislative, policy, and program discussions related to service, which will help the country achieve the ambitious goals of the Serve America Act.</li>
